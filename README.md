Copy and run the following command to download the shell script. This script can be used in lieu of running `python3` directly.

This way you can run your code like normal and the script will remind you to commit your code. It is recommended that you use this script since Enki can display the log files that it generates in the UI.

```sh
curl "https://enki-dist.s3.amazonaws.com/py-commit" -s -o /usr/local/bin/py-commit && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/py-commit
```
